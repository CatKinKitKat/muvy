== Description

This is a plain and simple React Single page dynamic webapp, which uses a Bootstrap theme (Lux) as the CSS framwork and component library.

This is another frontend for the TMDb API, from which you can do (almost) everything the API provides, from accounts, searching, trailers, favourites, watchlists... list goes on and on.
